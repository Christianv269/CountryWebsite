            <h3>Colosseum</h3>
            <h2>The Colosseum was built
                as a massive free public space
                for giant crowds to watch and enjoy gladiator
                fights and showcases, as well as executions around
                animal fights.

            <h3>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h3>
            <h2>The leaning tower of Pisa
                was meant to be straight but due to
                the softness of the ground it had started to
                lean over and it was built to showcase the city's 
                wealth and power in the 12th century.

            <h3>Trevi Fountain</h3>
            <h2>The Trevi fountain was built to mark 
                the terminal point of the now restored aqua
                virgo aqueduct, it also made a nice artistic focal
                point for Rome's water source. It was built
                in the 1730s.
