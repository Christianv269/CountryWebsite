            <h3>Romulus and Remus</h3>
            <h2>The Story of Romulus and Remus
                is a weird but very interesting and 
                significant part of Roman history.
                The story starts off with twins being
                born and abandoned by their mother. They were found
                and nursed by a wolf and had later gone on to be raised
                by a shepard and after all this time had overthrown a tyrant
                unfortunately the twins in their rivalry had fought and 
                Romulus had killed his brother Remus, becoming the sole founder
                of the city.

            <h3>Gladiator</h3>
            <h2>Gladiators where a big piece of history
                in Rome, these warriors where people
                who would fight in the now known colosseum.
                Fighting against other gladiators, slaves, prisoners
                and animals. They were very strong combatants who carried
                around weaponry such as a short sword, spears, and shields
                for defense and offensive attacks. Gladiators were not treated
                well and were often looked down upon besides entertainment
                purposes. They were very often slaves used to fight for 
                the people and possibly freedom or prisoners forced into
                the colosseum. Unfortunately gladiators were very often
                killed in battle, bled out, or couldn't take the suffering
                anymore and commited suicide.

            <h3>Colosseum</h3>
            <h2>The Colosseum is a major part in Roman History.
                This project was started by the Emperor Vespasian.
                He'd pass away before this project was completed leaving
                his two sons in charge to finish the colosseum. Now what
                was the colosseum used for? It was used for Gladiator fights
                and showings. These fights could also be prisoners and slaves
                fighting for there freedom either against gladiators or up
                against wild animals in a fight to the death where you would
                be watched by up to 50-80 thousand people wanting bloodshed
                as this was a big part of entertainment in Rome at the time
                period.
